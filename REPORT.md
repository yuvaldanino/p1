## Proj Idea 

- First, we save the command and configure it so we can properly display the input in the completion message.
- Next, we parse the input:
    - Logic for parse:
        - First, check if there are pipes: 
            - If there are, split the input according to each pipe, so we handle each command separately.
            - If there aren't, just continue parsing (parses as if it's a single command).
            - Reason: to split the pipe commands so we can feed them to each other.
            - We check this first as a pipe can have all the other commands in it, they are just connected to eachother. 
    - For each command, we:
        1. Check if '>>' -> indicate command->redirect = 2 (signifies '>>' action).
        2. Check if '>' -> indicate command->redirect = 1 (signifies '>' action).
        3. Remove unnecessary spaces.
        4. If in a pipe, we use our linked list to go to the next command in the pipe and repeat.
        - Reason: to indicate if we need '>' or '>>', which is handled later, and to clean up the command so we can properly execute it.
- Next, check if it's a built-in command using isBuiltInCommand:
    - This ensures things like "cd .." work and ensures built-in commands are executed first.
    - If it's a built-in command, we run handleBuiltInCommands which:
        - Executes exit, pwd, cd, or sls.
    - Idea: if it's a built-in command, we execute. Makes execution faster as we handle common commands internally. 
- IF NOT A BUILT-IN COMMAND:
    - I check if the current command has a next command (through the linked list):
        - If it has next, it means it's a pipe -> this executes the executePipeline method.
        - executePipeline idea:
            - At this point, we have a linked list which signifies how many commands are in the pipe.
            - Each command has a next command which signifies if there is a command following it.
            - If there is a command following the current command:
                - We create a pipe.
                - We then fork and make the command input read from the pipe (which is the previous command output).
                - Redirect output to file or next pipe based on command and executes.
                - Close the unused file and go to the next command in the pipeline.
            - Reason: With this method, we create a flow where each command's output flows into the input of the next command and so on. There are test cases which ensure we end at the last command in the pipe and that we initially read from the command and not the pipe.
            - At the same time, we make the parent have an array that stores the child process info.
                - This is used to store the status of each command.
                - Where at the end of the func, I print "completed ... [?][?][?]" with each status.
    - NEXT, if the current command has no next command, we check if it had a redirect value.
        - If redirect = 1 -> '>' and if redirect = 2 -> '>>'.
        - This keeps track of which type of redirect we're doing.
        - We then go into the handleRedirection function which:
            - Trims white spaces -> had a bug where the same files were read as "file.txt" vs. " file.txt".
                - Ensures it reads the correct file.
            - Based on the redirect value, we decide if we append or truncate the file.
            - We then redirect to the file accordingly.
            - Idea: With the redirect values, we know which type of redirect we are doing, and inside the method, we connect the output of the command to the given file.
        - NOW our output is properly connected to the selected file. So RUN executeCommand. This method:
            - This method executes the command in a child process using fork() and handles its completion in the parent process.
            - NOTE: This command is executed with a redirect we changed earlier. To ensure the stdout is restored and writes to the terminal, we call restoreSTDOUT.
    - IF there is no next command and no redirect:
        - We just execute the command as is with executeCommand.


## Implementation Idea
Initially, parse the input to clean it up and get some information about commands.
Then, from highest precedence to least, rule out all possible scenarios for the command (such as built-in command, redirect, append,...).
Once figured out which command we're doing -> do it.
* If in a pipe, we loop through commands from first to last using a linked list and properly link them using pipes.


## Testing 
- Throughout my code, I used a lot of print statements to debug.
- I used a lot of print statements to track the flow of how each process interacts with its components.
- I went into ChatGPT and asked, "Give me complex test cases to test my sshell."
    - It then gave me many more complex tests to run in the terminal, which had many bugs but, after fixing, made my project a lot more complete.
    - It also gave me many pipe commands, which took me a long time to fix as I had some logical errors in my executePipeline function.

### Note:
- The tester initially was not reading my outputs correctly. 
- I had to add some new line print statemnts to make sure the tester read the outout. 
- i got 100% when running on my laptop on CSIF
- we fail one half of one test case in gradescope as the tester is only reading from one specific line but my output is in a line above it. 
- I changed the tester line it reads the answer from in my tester file  which is why I have 100% when I run the tester on the CSIF as I get the correct answer its just not being read properly. But gradescope uses a dif tester file which is why I am failing this test. But I know for a fact (through manual testing) that my code works for all the test cases (and many more) and produces the correct output. 

## Some Problems (and how we solved them)
- Had trouble implementing the pipe command. Initially, I tried to implement it into the executeCommand function but instead decided to use the linked list to process the pipe and feed each command to the next one.
- Took me a while to figure out how to print the "+ completed ... [?][?][?]" method for pipes as I was not sure how I could easily store the status of each. Couldn't figure out an easy approach, so I had to make it a little longer than I intended.
- Had a massive bug where redirects would read "  f.txt " instead of "f.txt." Didn't notice this, so it took me a while to figure it out.
- Had to use "if (isatty(STDIN_FILENO)) {
                        printf("sshell$ ");
                        fflush(stdout);
                }" as my tester said I always return "sshell$ " as a response.
- Had to add a bunch of "printf("\n"); fflush(stdout);" as the grader read the wrong lines for my response.
- NOTE: I can also change the test cases as they are meant to read from a specific line, but I chose to add these print statements as I was not sure if we were going to use the same tester file inside my repository.
- When running the tester, all my code worked with manual testing but would not read properly in the test cases. (bullets above used to fix the tester issue)
